This application provides a sandbox environment for experimenting with the effects of gravity.
It offers the following features:

- Simulation of gravity in three dimensions
- Objects of varying size can be added to the scene with arbitrary initial trajectories
- The predicted path of the object is shown
- Objects merge upon collision
- History trails are drawn for each object
- The simulation speed can be adjusted
- A force grid shows the gravitational potential
- Objects can be made static
- An actor can be added to the scene with a dedicated chase cam
- Targets can be placed in the scene to be collected by the actor
